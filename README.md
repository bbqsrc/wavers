# Wavers
This README is in a state of major work-in-progress. However, the wiki page for Wavers, which outlines a lot about the project and how to use Wavers is in much more of a completed state. Please refer to that page for information. This README currently only contains information on building Wavers.

Provided Rust is installed and you can run the ``cargo`` command from the project root, it is simply:

``cargo build``

or, for a release version

``cargo build --release``

## Running Wavers tests
``cargo test``

## Running the benchmark
``cargo bench``
